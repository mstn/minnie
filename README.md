# Notes about Arch on Asus C100pa (minnie)

Here, I am collecting notes about my attempts to make Arch run on my Asus C100pa. It is not a tutorial, but a way to document what I found useful.

# Why C100pa

I am looking for a computing companion for my hikes. C100pa looks like a good candidate:

* cheap, you can find a second hand for less than 200â‚¬ on ebay;
* long battery life, more than 11 hours;
* lightweight, less than 1kg;
* screen usable in sunlight.

Moreover, I like the idea to give new life to old models. It is a way to reduce [ewaste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste) and help the planet.
